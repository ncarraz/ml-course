Over the past years, Machine Learning has added considerable value to activities and businesses. It is now an important competitive advantage. However, it requires a lot of good data in order to get the best performance. Labelling huge amounts of data can be a limitation for companies who want to take advantage of Machine learning. This is the challenge we are proposing to solve so that organizations can focus on their main Machine Learning application tasks without worrying about data labelling.

The solution is to provide good labelled data to any organizations or individuals who want to start or scale Machine Learning projects. Being able to get production-quality data in a fast and efficient way can accelerate Machine Learning projects. The main components are : data labelling, data collection, data cleansing. The work is performed by trained labelers assisted by Machine Learning models.  This allows fast and accurate labelling. Even if the models get better, there are still trained humans in the loop for quality insurance. We can say this is a solution for Machine Learning by Machine Learning  and people. 
The clients send unlabelled data,  poorly labelled data or request a certain type of data and we provide good labelled data.
